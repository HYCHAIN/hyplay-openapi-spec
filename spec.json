This endpoint is designed to be highly flexible. It can read any contract by providing a contract address for `contractIdOrAddress`. It can also read using contracts created in the HYCHAIN systems through the `POST /v1/contracts` endpoint, which will utilize the contract's ABI.\n\nAdditionally, reads can be performed as a HYCHAIN app, user or user's session provided, through header authorization, or any arbitrary address or walletId provided through the `as` query parameter. Alternatively you can omit all of this and perform a read as no specific address.\n\nThe `func` query parameter accepts a complete function signature with parameters, such as `getCount()` or `readCounter(address,uint256)`, or a known function name without parameters if a contractId was provided for `contractIdOrAddress` and the contract's ABI is known. Such as `readCounter`.","tags":["Contracts"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/pathContractIdOrAddress"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/headerAuthorizationAppSecretOptional"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/headerAuthorizationSessionOptional"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/headerAuthorizationUserOptional"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/queryChain"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/queryFunc"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/queryArgs"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/queryAs"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Returns the result of the contract read as a string.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"string"}}}},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401"}}}},"/v1/sessions":{"delete":{"operationId":"endSession","summary":"End session","description":"Ends all active sessions for a given user.
